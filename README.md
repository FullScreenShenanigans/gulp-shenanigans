# gulp-shenanigans

Unified Gulp tasks for FullScreenShenanigans projects.

## Why?

There are over two dozen repositories in the FullScreenShenanigans organization.
This unifies common build logic and can be updated more easily than editing each individual repository.

See https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/Documentation/blob/master/Build%20Details.md for more information.
